# C Language Programs

This repository contains a collection of C programs demonstrating fundamental concepts in C programming.

1. **Pointer Arithmetic:** Demonstrates pointer arithmetic and data type sizes.
2. **Function Call and Variable Addresses:** Shows memory addresses of local variables in different functions.
3. **Pointer Initialization and Memory Information:** Initializes pointers and prints addresses, values, and sizes of `double`, `int`, and `char` variables.
4. **Multithreading and Mutex:** Uses multithreading and mutex locks to perform arithmetic operations on a shared variable.
5. **Basic Multithreading:** Creates two threads performing independent operations.
6. **Multithreading with Shared Memory:** Accesses and modifies a shared variable using threads and measures execution time.
